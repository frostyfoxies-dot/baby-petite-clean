# Apple Pay Domain Verification File

This is a placeholder file for Apple Pay domain verification.

## How to Set Up Apple Pay Domain Verification

1. **Register for Apple Pay in Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Payment methods
   - Enable Apple Pay
   - Follow the setup instructions

2. **Download the Verification File:**
   - Stripe will provide a domain verification file
   - The file should be named `apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`
   - Replace this placeholder file with the actual verification file from Stripe

3. **File Location:**
   - The file must be accessible at: `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`
   - This file should be served without any file extension

4. **Verify Domain in Stripe:**
   - After deploying the file, verify your domain in the Stripe Dashboard
   - Stripe will check for the file and confirm domain ownership

5. **Production Requirements:**
   - Your site must be served over HTTPS
   - The domain must match exactly (including www vs non-www)

## For Local Development

Apple Pay requires HTTPS and won't work on localhost by default.
For local testing, you can:
- Use ngrok or similar tunneling service with HTTPS
- Test on a staging environment with proper HTTPS

## Note

DO NOT commit the actual verification file to version control if it contains sensitive data.
Add the actual file to .gitignore and use environment-specific deployment.
